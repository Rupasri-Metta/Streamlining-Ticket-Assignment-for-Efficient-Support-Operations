# Automated-Network-Request-Management-in-ServiceNow

## 📖 Project Description
This project demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a **Service Catalog** and **automation workflows** in ServiceNow.  
The goal was to design, configure, and test key features such as catalog items, variables, tables, approvals, and flows to deliver a smooth request lifecycle — from **submission to closure**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a Service Catalog with structured categories and reusable variable sets.  
- Create custom tables aligned with catalog items for request data management.  
- Implement approval workflows using related lists and Flow Designer.  
- Configure flows and actions for request handling and notifications.  
- Perform final testing and validation through the Service Portal.

## ⚙️ Implementation Approach
The project was executed in **six phases**, each focusing on a core ServiceNow capability:

1. **Service Catalog Creation** – Defined catalog, categories, variables, variable sets, and UI policies.  
2. **Table Creation** – Built custom tables, fields, and form layouts aligned with catalog items.  
3. **Request Approvals** – Configured related lists to capture approval workflows.  
4. **Flow Designer Overview** – Explored triggers, actions, subflows, and data pills.  
5. **Flow Implementation** – Designed end-to-end flows for request handling with approvals, notifications, and status updates.  
6. **Final Testing** – Performed Service Portal, email, and end-to-end workflow validation.

## 📊 Outcomes
- Successfully implemented a Service Catalog with dynamic variables and reusable sets.  
- Created custom tables with proper field properties and relationships.  
- Built and tested approval workflows linked to request records.  
- Designed flows in Flow Designer for automation of tasks and notifications.  
- Validated the end-to-end lifecycle:  
  **Request Submission → Approval Workflow → Notifications → Fulfillment → Closure**

## ✅ Key Learnings
- Designing scalable catalogs with reusable configurations.  
- Using Flow Designer for modular and reusable automation.  
- Importance of UI policies and variable sets in improving end-user experience.  
- Best practices in testing workflows to ensure reliability.
